# timeCommit
Easy-to-use scheduling application for work shift assignment by preference

#### Problem Domain:

The inspiration for this application comes from an onboarding process of volunteers at Crisis Connections, but is usable in any employee/volunteer onboarding process where shift hours must be established.

The picture below depicts a sheet where a coulenteer can pick days they would like to work based on company need, as colorcoded
The employee has the option to place a priority (1-3) for the shifts they want and submit their choices.

TimeCommit is a sytem that allows user to commit their avalibility to a weekly schedule.
There are two roles available: Admin/Employee (volunteer). 

Admins maintain the system by approving users hours, adjusting the days/timeslots based on need, and approve an employee's choices. Once approved, the system emails the employee a notification that their choices have been approved. Users and namangers will be able to sign in and see the schedule at any time.
